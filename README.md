# sqlairexperiment
Exercise on how to parse, prepare, execute and Scan values with sqlair

This is just an experiment to explore some possibilities for parsing SQLair's DSL and doing the full pipeline of a query from parsing, to execution and retrieving the values from the resultset.

It is far from complete. The code doesn't adhere to any standards whatsoever as this was just a PoC.
To run the tests, execute:

```
go test
```

To see a full example, run:

```
go run main.go
```
